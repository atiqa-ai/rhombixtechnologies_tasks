# 2.Fabonacci generator
The Fibonacci Generator is a Python program that generates Fibonacci numbers using the yield keyword.
Instead of creating the entire sequence at once, it produces each number one-by-one — making it fast, memory-efficient, and elegant.

⚙️ Features

✨ Generates Fibonacci numbers up to any range you choose

✨ Uses Python’s generator function (yield) for smooth performance
